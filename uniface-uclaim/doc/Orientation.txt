a) Customization

   a.1) Configuration
   a.2) Customizations made for this demo
   a.3) Changing look & feel

Detail
======
a) Customization

a.1) Change the company name from "ACME Insurance"
- modify the M_LOGO message and re-compile

a.2) Change site look & feel
- See "Use of AdminLTE 2 template" below

b) Use of AdminLTE 2 template

Look and feel is based on the popular AdminLTE framework, which is built on Bootstrap.
See https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/index2.html

Developer documentation can be found at:
https://almsaeedstudio.com/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html

The originial demo screen is included in the committed code and can be viewed from your web browser,
e.g. http://localhost:8080/acme_demo_v10/AdminLTE-2.2.0/index2.html (also index.html)

b.1) Configuration

CSS for the desktop application based upon index.html is loaded in hts\dtop_main.html.

Where related libraries were loaded from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in index.html, this has been changed to a local copy that has been added to the commit.
Related Javascript files are loaded separately from a JSON file depending upon the WRD used, to ensure they are loaded after the Uniface Web Framework, see the files in conf, e.g.

menu.dtop.json  - Desktop App
menu.chui.json  - iPhone App
menu.mpoly.json - Android App

b.2) Customizations made for this demo.

appinc.js performs AdminLTE initialization. It can be found in web\AdminLTE-2.2.0\dist\js.
This is a copy of the standard app.js supplied with AdminLTE, which has been modified to defer option configuration.

Specifically, $(function () {
has been changed to 

$.AdminLTE.dtopInitialize = function () {

The dtopInitialize function is then called from dtop_menu.createjs when dtop_menu is first initialized.

Note: the $(function () { syntax is a JQuery shortcut for $(document).ready(function(){


b.3) Changing look and feel

AdminLTE 2 skin selection is hard-coded in the layout for dtop_main.html (in the hts folder), e.g.
<body class="skin-blue-light">

You can select a different class as desired from the available skins folder 
(web/AdminLTE-2.2.0/dist/css/skins).

If you want something more customized, you can create your own skin using the LESS pre-compiler.

For more information and some preview links for the various skins, 
please see the AdminLTE2.0 documentation:
