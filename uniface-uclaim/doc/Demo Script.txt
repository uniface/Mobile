1. Overview of demo app
	- Scene setting, quick look at demo app


2. Discuss IDE projects
	- Good starting point to give overview of Uniface development object types (model, components, libraries etc)
	- Means we can open objects directly from the project rather then using the Ubar

3. Look at a component (Do this before the model as the model is abstract - the component is more real)
	- Explain component structure (Define Structure tab)
	- Look at local proc script (Write Script tab)
	- Explain structure -> layout binding (Design Layout tab)

4. Discuss model driven approach (explain how this helps us create consistant components)
	- Open a modelled entity (right click -> open from project editor)
	- Look at keys, relationships, entities
	- Look at some modelled trigger proc script


5. Add a field to a DSP
	- A record view screen is missing a field from the model
	- Go and look at the field in the model
	- Add it to the DSP structure - show that field properties have been inherited from model into the DSP
	- Add it to the layout
	- Compile / Run
	- Show field in app suitably populated with data

6. Write contact information to phone
	- Add "save to contacts" button to customer DSP structure
	- Goto Write Script tab and drop some snippet code into the button
	 - Perhaps have 2 versions of snippet code. Start with proc script and then explain that we can do all this client-side and drop in JavaScript instead. Explain how Uniface handles each use case for the developer
	- Add button to layout
	- Compile run
	- Demo in app
	- Show contact in phone's contact app




Issues
------
Duplicate fields after import
 - In 9 create a DSP, add an entity and paint all of its fields
 - Remove all by 1 of the fields
 - Export the DSP and import it into 10
 - Try adding one of the fields that was previously deleted
 - Error message "Duplicate found. The object you are trying to insert is already part of the structure"
 - Workaround: clean up component before export from 9
